# StyleSwipe

Our objective is to create and develop a mobile app that assists in find clothes that you like. Fashion enthusiasts, who will generally be young, can use the app on the go to help them select something that they would like to buy. The app will need to work around the screen sizes and shapes of mobile phones as well as adapt to the control scheme of mobile phones.  It should be tailored towards tennagers as well. The app should be completed within a  one month period and have no extra cost. Users should be able to create accounts, and select clothes they like by swiping. They should be able to get purchasing information and upload their own images. They should be able to see how many people are looking at each piece of clothing and have a wardrobe of clothes that they swiped for.
